### Deployment

DEPLOYED THROUGH HEROKU CLI, HAD SEVERAL ISSUES WHILE DEPLOYING
ISSUES RESOLVED BY FOLLOWING THESE STEPS:

1)create server.js in root directory and serve index.html

2)add 
"engines": {
    "node": "16.15.0"
  },

3) add node.js and https://buildpack-registry.s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app.tgz
   build packs to react app in settings.
   
   
   Plain and simple now deploy that thing and enjoy !!!!

P.S FOR THE PROJECT PLEASE !
